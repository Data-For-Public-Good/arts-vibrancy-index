The museum maintains the nation's largest permanent collection of moving image artifacts, numbering almost 100,000 objects. The collection explores the changing ways in which moving images have been produced and exhibited. The study of the material culture of the moving image extends beyond the art of cinema and is crucial to the understanding of American culture and social history. In this project, the museum will begin to catalog, digitize, and make accessible online its collection of moving image material culture, using a significant selection of its rare silent film era collection to initiate the process. A key element of this initiative will be the advancement of work on OpenCollection, the museum's commissioned software package, which is already in use in a preliminary version. Through this project, the museum will dramatically increase its capacity for cataloging, access, and display of its materials. In addition, it will make a vital contribution to the field by developing nonproprietary software that can be used by other collections of moving image material culture around the world."

What different types of learning experiences do users have using printable machines in the museum and classroom settings? Are different types of learning better suited to one or the other of the two distinct contexts? What terminology, descriptive protocols, and asset management practices will enable original artifacts, digital representations, and printable machines to be accurately and appropriately found, accessed, and utilized by users within a library environment?"

The primary goal is to strengthen museum capacity for institutionwide conservation planning, recognizing the importance of preserving and sustaining one of the preeminent repositories of the nation's cultural heritage. The methodology-implemented by a team of senior-level participants from AMNH science, conservation, and operations staff-is based on a quantitative risk-assessment model developed by the Canadian Museum of Nature and pilot tested at AMNH. The resulting report will allow the museum to prioritize collection needs in an objective and relational way, providing the foundation of a long-term plan for the most effective use of resources to address the highest conservation priorities.

YUM's new quarters in lower Manhattan make the museum accessible to a much larger audience that is more diverse in terms of age and ethnicity and more responsive to a variety of adult programs. In concert with its mission and strategic plan, the museum has been working to increase its capacity to inspire lifelong learning by expanding public programming in its new location. To this end, the museum will add a permanent staff member for public programming; conduct pre- and postproject demographic evaluations to diversify the audience; and strategically plan an approach to public programming that will appeal to a wide variety of people. These steps are important to institutional development. The public programming staff member supported by this grant will work on YUM's exhibition ""A Perfect Fit: The Garment Industry and American Jewry."" This exhibition will provide an excellent starting point for audience outreach. It breaks new ground in scholarship, as it unifies research in several fields to explore a widely acknowledged but little examined area of the development of the United States as a great industrial nation during the crucial years from 1860 to 1960."

In this two-year project, the museum will support and expand Queens International, the restructured public events program initiative aimed at bringing new and diverse audiences to the museum. Queens International established the museum as a venue for artistic presentations, a community gathering place, and a forum for cultural exchange. Through a series of weekly events featuring world music, dance, and film, Queens International will establish a dialogue between the museum and the numerous communities of Queens, cultivating cultural understanding and highlighting the work of local artists. This project is intended to foster new relationships with community-based arts and social service organizations, resulting in an ongoing program of regularly scheduled public events."

A survey of the field conducted by the Image Permanence Institute (IPI) of Rochester Institute of Technology found that 80 percent of cultural institutions have inkjet prints in their collections, that they are concerned about continuing influxes of these materials, and that they are not well informed about how to care for them. The same survey showed that objectionable deterioration has already occurred, including fading, yellowing, color bleed, surface cracking and delamination.
