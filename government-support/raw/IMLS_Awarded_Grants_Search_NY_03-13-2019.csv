The museum maintains the nation's largest permanent collection of moving image artifacts, numbering almost 100,000 objects. The collection explores the changing ways in which moving images have been produced and exhibited. The study of the material culture of the moving image extends beyond the art of cinema and is crucial to the understanding of American culture and social history. In this project, the museum will begin to catalog, digitize, and make accessible online its collection of moving image material culture, using a significant selection of its rare silent film era collection to initiate the process. A key element of this initiative will be the advancement of work on OpenCollection, the museum's commissioned software package, which is already in use in a preliminary version. Through this project, the museum will dramatically increase its capacity for cataloging, access, and display of its materials. In addition, it will make a vital contribution to the field by developing nonproprietary software that can be used by other collections of moving image material culture around the world."

The project team will produce a new, fully accessible exhibition design to reflect best practices and innovations in the field; be more accessible to a broader audience; and provide greater access to the museum's permanent collection. Staff and board members will work with scholars, community liaisons, an accessibility consultant, and an exhibition designer to define a narrative scope and interpretive approach for the new exhibition, and identify associated artifacts, interactive experiences, media clips, and other elements. The preliminary design will incorporate the perspectives and needs of diverse learners to more effectively serve people with disabilities and cultural barriers."

Currently, five restored apartments present the stories of actual families who lived there, selected from approximately 7,000 people who resided n the building between 1863 and 1935.

Phase III (6/04-5/05) the team will build and install the systems at all 3 institutions, test their operation, integrate them into the daily work.  Phase IV (6/05-10/05) the team will disseminate project results through publications, workshops, and graduate fellowship opportunities.
