While a successful painter and theatrical designer, John Eric Broaddus received international critical acclaim for his contributions to a less visible art form--the ""artist's book."" The artist's book is an ancient form, which probably began with the illuminated manuscript tradition of ancient Persia and continued through monastic Christian practices in medieval Europe. Artists such as Duchamp, Picasso, and Matisse experimented with this form, and many contemporary artists work in this form today. Most artist's books are owned by private collectors and are rarely exhibited publicly. Several major American museums have acquired and exhibited artist's books with limited success. The proposed 27-minute film will introduce large audiences to this rich artform while examining the accomplishments of the late John Eric Broaddus whose numerous works have appeared in exhibitions and permanent collections in the U.S. and Europe, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Center for Book Arts in New York, the French Bibiliotheque Nationale, the Frankfurt Book Fair, the Salon du Livre of the Grand Palais in Paris, the",1998,12,"$15,000 ",5/1/1998,4/30/1999

The goal of this project is for 30 12th-grade students from the Beacon School, an alternative high school whose core philosophy is that the arts should be completely integrated into the full curriculum, to increase their knowledge of the arts in general and to acquire specific skills that will lead to the creation of a public exhibition and performance. Students are drawn from all areas of New York City, and the majority are African-American or Latino. The project has two core components: 1) intensive apprenticeship/mentoring over a 7-month period in which students learn about the specific work of the artist, receive training in the discipline, work on their contribution to the performance piece, and are exposed to other art forms through visits to performing organizations, museums, or specially-selected events; and 2) participation over 5 months in the development of a public exhibition and performance piece, under the leadership of a professional producer/director, that will be presented to the general public and youth groups at a recognized venue(s), and performed/produced by the participants.",1998,10,"$15,000 ",3/1/1998,6/30/1999

Inaugurated in 1968, the artist-in-residence program is a seminal museum education program. It provides twelve-month residencies to three emerging artists of African descent. The resident artists receive a $10,000 to $15,000 stipend as well as supplies, studio space, and an exhibition at the end of their tenure. An average of 100 national and international artists apply each year. A selection committee made up of the museum's curatorial, education, and administrative staff reviews the applications and selects six finalists. Studio visits are conducted with all finalists, three of whom are chosen to participate in the program. Each artist spends a minimum of 20 hours per week during business hours in the studio at the museum, and is available to speak to scheduled tour groups. These studio visits are often the initial museum experience for children as well as adults living in communities traditionally underserved by museums.

John Wollaston was active in painting from 1742 to 1775 and arrived in the American colonies in 1749. It was just at this time that general wealth and cultural sophistication of the British-ruled colony of New York rose markedly, and a taste emerged for portraiture executed in the latest styles fashionable among members of London society. Wollaston introduced unique stylistic mannerisms in his portraits and achieved immediate popularity, being commissioned by over 300 American colonists during his career. Although many of America's older art museums contain examples of individual and single paired portraits by the artist, this quartet of related three-quarter length portraits is singular. This suite of portraits memorializes two generations of affluent families whose separate fortunes were strengthened further through marriage. They were commissioned on the occasion of Margaret Marston's marriage to Philip Philipse in 1751, and descendants of the Philipse family donated them to the museum in 1932 when it opened its new building on Fifth Avenue.",1998,13,"$5,000 ",3/1/1998,4/30/1999

One of the primary artists involved in the project will be the playwright, Carmen Rivera, who was selected to write the play because of her great interest in Julia De Burgos.

In creating and producing this drama, Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre wants to pay tribute to a renowned artist, enlighten its English-speaking audiences about her poetry and stature as an icon in the Puerto Rican community, share with their youth her talent and her story, and support the playwright Carmen Rivera in her expression as an artist and as a Puerto Rican woman.

In its first year, more than 4,000 organizations participated in the event, 500 stories were generated in the print media across the country, and the nation's two largest bookstore chains, Borders Books and Barnes  Noble, reported a 35 and 25 percent increase respectively in the sale of poetry books during April. For the 1998 and 1999 celebrations, the Academy of American Poets will host high-profile national programs during the month, provide outreach materials to assist local organizations in the creation of their own programming, and secure national publicity for the initiative. The Academy will create an on-line poetry classroom and produce an interactive festival on its web site, collaborate with the Urban Libraries Council to present a 30-city, 30-day series of readings, distribute free volumes of selected poetry, and produce a live multi-author event at the Library of Congress.",1998,10,"$95,000 ",1/1/1998,5/31/1998

Despite his immensely prolific writing career with an oeuvre of 30 large volumes, he was known largely for a single book, Berlin Alexanderplatz, after which he was forced into exile by the Nazis. Published in 1924, his 630-page novel, Mountains Seas and Giants, is a history of war-torn civilization and the conflict between technology and nature, from the aftermath of World War I into the 27th century. It presciently describes ecological catastrophe, mass migrations, state surveillance, terrorism, genetic engineering, and biological warfare.

Thirty stations in New York alone aired Jewish programming: advice shows, variety shows, man- on-the-street interviews, news programs, music and game shows in both Yiddish and English. A decade ago, the ethnomusicologist, Henry Sapoznik (credited with sparking the klezmer music revival in the United States) discovered a pile of 16"" aluminum discs in a musty storage room in New York City which included titles such as ""Yiddish Melodies in Swing,"" ""Stuhmer's Pumpernickel Program,"" and ""Life is Funny with Harry Hirschfield, Sponsored by Edelstiens Tuxedo Brand Cheese."" Sapoznik has spent the last ten years searching for additional discs and has amassed the largest (and only) collection of Yiddish radio in the world.

Bang on a Can's three artistic directors, composers Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe, initiated this two year project to take the organization's adventurous aesthetic into a new medium. They saw the link with comics in that this form fits with Bang on a Can's democratic sensibility, bringing art directly and accessibly to a broad and diverse audience. In the work of Ben Katchor they identified a kindred soul whose New York is a city of bizarre pitchmen, loners, insomniacs, pensioners, and uncommon individuals, such as the man who has ridden every elevator in the city, and knows their obscure histories and lore. The composers were drawn to how well certain aspects of Katchor's work would present themselves in a theater, both his simple and evocative visual style and his clean direct language that will set well to music. For the consortium partner, the Arts Festival of Atlanta, this project addresses concerted efforts to offer new interdisciplinary arts events to challenge audiences and enrich the cultural life of the community.
